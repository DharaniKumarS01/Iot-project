📡 Air Quality Monitoring System using IoT
This project is an IoT-based Air Quality Monitoring System that measures and reports environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, and air quality in real-time. It uses the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, DHT11 sensor, and MQ135 gas sensor to gather data and transmit it wirelessly to a cloud platform or IoT dashboard.

🛠️ Components Used
ESP8266 (NodeMCU) – Microcontroller with Wi-Fi capability

DHT11 – Temperature and humidity sensor

MQ135 – Gas sensor for detecting air pollutants (e.g., CO₂, NH₃, alcohol, benzene)

Connecting wires & breadboard

🎯 Key Features
Real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, and air quality

Wireless data transmission via Wi-Fi

Simple and affordable design using common IoT components

Potential integration with IoT platforms like Blynk, Thingspeak, or Firebase

📌 Use Cases
Indoor air quality tracking

Smart home or classroom environment monitoring

Low-cost environmental sensing for smart cities
